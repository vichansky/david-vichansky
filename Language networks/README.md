## Forthcoming project (release August 2021).

We explore the paper 'Loops and Self-Reference in the Consturction of Dictionaryies' (https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.2.031018) to analyse how random language really is.

We use Topological Data Analysis on the network graph to obtain structure of the network.

This project was done as part of the Applied Data Science profile offered by Utrecht University, NL.
