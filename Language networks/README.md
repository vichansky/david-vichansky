## About the project

This project was used to explore the paper 'Loops and Self-Reference in the Consturction of Dictionaryies' (https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.2.031018) in order to analyse how random language really is. Topological Data Analysis is used on a network graph to understand its structure, followed by MCMC double edge-swap rewiring and smaller loop detection.

This project was done as part of the Applied Data Science profile offered by Utrecht University, NL (supervisor: Ivan Kryven).
